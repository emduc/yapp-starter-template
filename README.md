This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install deps, etc.

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the yapp on port 3069:

```
PORT=3069 npm run dev
```

Open the yapp inside the Yodl Pay iFrame for yapps:

```
open https://yodl.me/y/yapplocal.eth
```

Note: yapplocal.eth resolves to localhost:3069.
See the configuration here: https://app.ens.domains/yapplocal.eth?tab=records
